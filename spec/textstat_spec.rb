       'important to the development of well-balanced and ' \
       'creative children; however, what part, if any, ' \
       'they should play in the lives of adults has never ' \
       'been researched that deeply. I believe that ' \
       'playing games is every bit as important for adults ' \
       'as for children. Not only is taking time out to ' \
       'play games with our children and other adults ' \
       'valuable to building interpersonal relationships ' \
       'but is also a wonderful way to release built up ' \
       "tension.\n" \
       "There's nothing my husband enjoys more after a " \
       'hard day of work than to come home and play a game ' \
       'of Chess with someone. This enables him to unwind ' \
       "from the day's activities and to discuss the highs " \
       'and lows of the day in a non-threatening, kick back ' \
       'environment. One of my most memorable wedding ' \
       'gifts, a Backgammon set, was received by a close ' \
       'friend. I asked him why in the world he had given ' \
       'us such a gift. He replied that he felt that an ' \
       'important aspect of marriage was for a couple to ' \
       'never quit playing games together. Over the years, ' \
       'as I have come to purchase and play, with other ' \
       'couples & coworkers, many games like: Monopoly, ' \
       'Chutes & Ladders, Mastermind, Dweebs, Geeks, & ' \
       'Weirdos, etc. I can reflect on the integral part ' \
       'they have played in our weekends and our ' \
       '"shut-off the T.V. and do something more ' \
       'stimulating" weeks. They have enriched my life and ' \
       'made it more interesting. Sadly, many adults ' \
       'forget that games even exist and have put them ' \
       'away in the cupboards, forgotten until the ' \
       "grandchildren come over.\n" \
       'All too often, adults get so caught up in working ' \
       'to pay the bills and keeping up with the ' \
       "\"Joneses'\" that they neglect to harness the fun " \
       'in life; the fun that can be the reward of ' \
       'enjoying a relaxing game with another person. It ' \
       'has been said that "man is that he might have ' \
       'joy" but all too often we skate through life ' \
       'without much of it. Playing games allows us to: ' \
       'relax, learn something new and stimulating, ' \
       'interact with people on a different more ' \
       'comfortable level, and to enjoy non-threatening ' \
       'competition. For these reasons, adults should ' \
       'place a higher priority on playing games in their ' \
       'lives'
